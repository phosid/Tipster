# Pre-work - *Tipster*

**Tipster** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Sidney Pho**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Split pricing between groups of people using a slider.
- [X] Created funny text that would change depending on how large the user tipped.
- [X] Designed a launch screen
- [X] Designed color theme with an app logo.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a demo:

## Notes

I had some difficulty getting my slider to respond initially and change values in the text field. I was able to apply what i've learned from the short video to get it to work. Also ran into some error exceptions with deleted or renamed UI labels, and had to reconnect them to get it work.
